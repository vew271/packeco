# Capstone Project - Bangkit 2021 - B21-CAP0229

## Project Description
**Name:** A Pack-Eco App

**Selected Theme:** Economic Resilience

**Summary:** According to research from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment, plastic waste has reached 26,500 tons per day. In supporting economic development and strengthening economic resilience for quality and competitive growth, we have 3 main points of concern as a basis for consideration in making project ideas.

1. The scattered locations of IKM and packing houses / UPTs 
2. Access of technology for product packaging and affordable packaging 
3. Access of affordable packaging materials for IKM and packaging houses / UPTs 

Therefore, our team created “Pack-Eco” as an application that will help IKMs by detecting food products and recommending eco-friendly packaging designs that are connected to information on the distribution location of eco-friendly packaging production sites closest to the IKM location
